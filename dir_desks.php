                                    <p>The world is fast changing. The world of technology even more so. Clearly the need of the hour is technocrats possessing leadership qualities with a global perspective on technological, economic & cultural interfaces with business. A prerequisite of leadership is to look beyond the present. To be an innovator in technology or a stimulant of change in society, you need to extend your current knowledge and capabilities. Our objective is to prepare leaders, who go beyond conventional technical skills.
I.E.R.T. is fast developing as a high quality institute of international standards in order to meet the needs of the fast changing 21st century world.
