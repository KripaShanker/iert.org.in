Hence, efforts are   						always directed towards creating a very rich library   						having all important National and International   						journals/ newspapers, encyclopedia and magazines. <strong>The   						institution houses two libraries: Main library and   						Reference library.</strong> These libraries are a physical   						manifestation of our vision to distinguish the college   						as a center of resource in the knowledge era. The   						libraries aim to fulfill the crucial role of supporting   						learning and teaching activities to all members of the   						Institute.</p>
<p align="justify">With  a collection of close to 40,000 books in addition to thousands of  journals and theses, the library is  one of the best in  the region. It has been our endeavor to provide both students and faculty  with the best possible research material including the latest writings  of management gurus, popular management texts, classical books on  management and much more.</p>
